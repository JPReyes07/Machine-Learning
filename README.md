# Machine-Learning

<div align="justify";>
Machine Learning involves the creation of models and algorithms to enable computer systems to learn from data and gradually improve their performance without the further need for explicit programming. The intelligence that it provides has expanded throughout a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, transportation, and marketing.  <br /><br />

I would like to first preface that my works here are still at the <b>basic</b> level that generally involves exploratory data analysis and model implementation. However though, what I greatly appreciate about this technical field is the ability to automate tedious and repetitive tasks, uncover insights in data, and solve real-world problems with data-driven approaches. It is an open window for creative thinking while understanding how models work their way through data. <br /><br />

With the myriad of opportunities and applications within machine learning, and the entire field of artificial intlligence, I am eager to learn more about it and improve my skills to someday contribute to the betterment of society.
